# 5 DoF-Servo motor 


STL Files
  The STL files are ready to print and assembled. Can get it at 

Hardware components
  1.	Arduino UNO
  2.	5V DC power supply
  3.	Jumper wires
  4.	Printed parts
  5.	M3 screws
  6.	Servo motor MG996 (x3), SG90 (x3)

Single Motor PID Coding
  1.	Please refer the coding for the connection of the SPG30E,motor driver and arduino.
  2.	Adjust the PPR accordingly to your type of SPG30E-xxxk for example, on cytron webpage, the ppr is 600 for 90 degree, so a full 360 is 2400.
